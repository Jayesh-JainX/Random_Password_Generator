# Random_Password_Generator
Random Password Generator in Python

In this Program, I have used 2 library 'random' and 'datetime', to select random charater and to get the live date and time.
All the Data\History of Password generated is Saved in a Text File(with date and time).
A user can get 3 different types of Password, Alphanumeric, Alphabetic or Numeric.
This Project was made on Jupiter, I have tried this Code on vs code and its word there too..
If Any Suggestions or Changes you have, share that to me, by mail.
